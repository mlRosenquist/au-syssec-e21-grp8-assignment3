As mentioned in the introduction, there is several setups in which the exploit can be utilized. The chosen setup consists of a VM spun up with a vulnerable image from Pentesterlab\cite{pentesterlab}. The VM has an apache server hosting a web application that uses a bash-based CGI script. The topology can be seen on figure \ref{fig:network-topology}.

The server has bash version 4.2.45(1)-release installed, which is a version vulnerable to shellshock. Furthermore the web application is hosted on port 80.
